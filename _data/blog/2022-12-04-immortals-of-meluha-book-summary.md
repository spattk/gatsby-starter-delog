title: Immortals of Meluha (Book Summary)
---




* Shiva was leading a tribe and was constantly pissed by unnecessary battles hampering the peace of his community.
* At times, the neighbouring location people invited him to Meluha where they claimed that it is the heaven, he will live a peaceful life without any fight. But Shiva, later realized their intention was to invite people from foreign lands in the search of their true Neelkanth who would save them from their miseries.
* After considerable thought, Shiva did go to the land of Meluhans and drank the Somras. With that his throat turned blue and people started respected him
* They considered him that he would truly alleviate their problems and would solve the remaining task of Sri Ram while he was totally confused of why he was getting such attention without any deeds.
* But Shiva was heavily impressed by the near perfect society of Meluhans and got to know the powerful nature of Somras and its healing capacity.
* Shiva was impressed by Sati and fell in love with her and tried every way to get to her even after he got to know she was a Vikarma
* He fought for it and then removed the law of Vikarma because it didn’t make fair for everyone and eventually got married to Sati after so many protests by the people.
* A lot of the times Nagas attacked on them in random location.
* The battle of Koonj was something that shattered shiva when a Naga hit an agniban to Sati.
* It took huge courage and trust along with Somras to make Sati recover and that’s when he decided that he will fight back to save the villages that the so called Chandravanshis attacked.
* After that Shiva’s good friend Brihaspati (the chief scientist) was in Mandar (the location of generation of Somras) and that place was attacked and then Shiva made it a deal to destroy the Chandravanshis and their leader Naga.
* He made proper plans with Parvateshwar and build an impeccable army and strategies and thus destroyed the Chandravanshis.
* But after the fight he couldn’t see any Nagas there and then thought that whether they were actually supporting the Chandravanshis.
* After numerous conversations with Pandit (the so called Vayuputras) and the princess of Swadweep, he got to know that they were also expecting the Neelkanth to join their side and they were not evil at all.
* Shiva regretted a lot after he figured out that he attacked a side which wasn’t actually evil but just different but the Pandit made him realize that it was inevitable.
* Then he got to the temple to find the actual answers.
* Then he returned back with such a guilt phase to see another Naga attacking Sati just outside the temple.
* To be continued.
