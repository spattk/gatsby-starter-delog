title: Why I don't like Happy New Year wishes !!!
---
It's has been a trend lately that people start to wish Happy New Year at the 31st of every year. (Saying it to be a trend is not correct, but let's say I consider it calling as trend).

* Thinking it as a fresh start (well everyone feels happy to start from a clean slate, but life is not all black and white)
* Nothing more than a date change.
* More than half of the new year resolutions don't make it past 5th week.



However, what I cherish most is that I am able to connect with people who I haven't had talked to for days or months.

I get to connect with old friends, acquaintances, relatives. I love that social connect.

Thanks for reading.
